(2)In Part 1 of Schedule 2 (assured tenancies: grounds on which court must order possession) after Ground 7A insert— Both of the following conditions are met in relation to a dwelling-house in England. Condition 1 is that the Secretary of State has given a notice in writing to the landlord or, in the case of joint landlords, one or more of them which identifies— (a)the tenant or, in the case of joint tenants, one or more of them, or (b)one or more other persons aged 18 or over who are occupying the dwelling-house, as a person or persons disqualified as a result of their immigration status from occupying the dwelling-house under the tenancy. Condition 2 is that the person or persons named in the notice— (a)fall within paragraph (a) or (b) of condition 1, and (b)are disqualified as a result of their immigration status from occupying the dwelling-house under the tenancy. For the purposes of this ground a person (“P”) is disqualified as a result of their immigration status from occupying the dwelling-house under the tenancy if— (a)P is not a relevant national, and (b)P does not have a right to rent in relation to the dwelling-house. P does not have a right to rent in relation to the dwelling-house if— (a)P requires leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom but does not have it, or (b)P's leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom is subject to a condition preventing P from occupying the dwelling-house. But P is to be treated as having a right to rent in relation to a dwelling-house if the Secretary of State has granted P permission for the purposes of this ground to occupy a dwelling-house under an assured tenancy. In this ground “relevant national” means— (a)a British citizen, (b)a national of anEEAState other than the United Kingdom, or (c)a national of Switzerland.” (3)In section 7 (orders for possession)— (a)in subsection (3) after “subsections (5A) and (6)” insert“ and section 10A ”, (b)in subsection (5A)(a) for “and 7A” substitute“ , 7A and 7B ”, (c)in subsection (6)(a) after “Ground 7A” insert“ , Ground 7B ”, and (d)after subsection (6A) insert— “(6B)The requirement in subsection (6)(b) that would otherwise apply to an order for possession of a dwelling-house let on an assured fixed term tenancy does not apply where the ground for possession is Ground 7B in Part 1 of Schedule 2 to this Act.” (4)In section 8(5) (cases where court may not dispense with notice of proceedings for possession) after “Ground 7A” insert“ , 7B ”. (5)After section 10 insert— (1)This section applies on an application for an order for possession of a dwelling-house let on an assured tenancy if the court is satisfied that— (a)Ground 7B in Schedule 2 is established, (b)no other ground in that Schedule is established, or one or more grounds in Part 2 of that Schedule are established but it is not reasonable to make an order for possession on that ground or those grounds, (c)the tenancy is a joint tenancy, and (d)one or more of the tenants is a qualifying tenant. (2)In subsection (1)(d) “qualifying tenant” means a person who (within the meaning of Ground 7B) is not disqualified as a result of the person's immigration status from occupying the dwelling-house under the tenancy. (3)The court may, instead of making an order for possession, order that the tenant's interest under the tenancy is to be transferred so that it is held— (a)if there is one qualifying tenant, by the qualifying tenant as sole tenant, or (b)if there is more than one qualifying tenant, by all of them as joint tenants. (4)The effect of an order under this section is that, from the time the order takes effect, the qualifying tenant or tenants— (a)are entitled to performance of the landlord's covenants under the tenancy, and (b)are liable to perform the tenant's covenants under the tenancy. (5)The effect of an order under this section is that, from the time it takes effect, any other person who was a tenant under the tenancy before the order took effect— (a)ceases to be entitled to performance of the landlord's covenants under the tenancy, or (b)ceases to be liable to perform the tenant's covenants under the tenancy. (6)Subsection (5) does not remove any right or liability of the person which accrued before the order took effect. (7)An order under this section does not operate to create a new tenancy as between the landlord and the qualifying tenant or tenants. (8)In particular, if the tenancy is a fixed term tenancy, the term comes to an end at the same time as if the order had not been made.” (6)In Part 1 of Schedule 15 to the Rent Act 1977 (grounds for possession of dwelling-houses let on or subject to protected or statutory tenancies) after Case 10 insert— Both of the following conditions are met in relation to a dwelling-house in England. Condition 1 is that the Secretary of State has given a notice in writing to the landlord or, in the case of joint landlords, one or more of them which identifies— (a)the tenant or, in the case of joint tenants, one or more of them, or (b)one or more other persons aged 18 or over who are occupying the dwelling-house, as a person or persons disqualified as a result of their immigration status from occupying the dwelling-house under the tenancy. Condition 2 is that the person or persons named in the notice— (a)fall within paragraph (a) or (b) of condition 1, and (b)are disqualified as a result of their immigration status from occupying the dwelling-house under the tenancy. For the purposes of this case a person (“P”) is disqualified as a result of their immigration status from occupying the dwelling-house under the tenancy if— (a)P is not a relevant national, and (b)P does not have a right to rent in relation to the dwelling-house. P does not have a right to rent in relation to the dwelling-house if— (a)P requires leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom but does not have it, or (b)P's leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom is subject to a condition preventing P from occupying the dwelling-house. But P is to be treated as having a right to rent in relation to a dwelling-house if the Secretary of State has granted P permission for the purposes of this case to occupy a dwelling-house which is for the time being let on a protected tenancy or subject to a statutory tenancy. In this case “relevant national” means— (a)a British citizen, (b)a national of an EEA State other than the United Kingdom, or (c)a national of Switzerland.” (7)The amendments made by this section apply in relation to a tenancy entered into before or after the coming into force of this section.

Condition 1 is that the Secretary of State has given a notice in writing to the landlord or, in the case of joint landlords, one or more of them which identifies— (a)the tenant or, in the case of joint tenants, one or more of them, or (b)one or more other persons aged 18 or over who are occupying the dwelling-house, as a person or persons disqualified as a result of their immigration status from occupying the dwelling-house under the tenancy. Condition 2 is that the person or persons named in the notice— (a)fall within paragraph (a) or (b) of condition 1, and (b)are disqualified as a result of their immigration status from occupying the dwelling-house under the tenancy. For the purposes of this case a person (“P”) is disqualified as a result of their immigration status from occupying the dwelling-house under the tenancy if— (a)P is not a relevant national, and (b)P does not have a right to rent in relation to the dwelling-house. P does not have a right to rent in relation to the dwelling-house if— (a)P requires leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom but does not have it, or (b)P's leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom is subject to a condition preventing P from occupying the dwelling-house. But P is to be treated as having a right to rent in relation to a dwelling-house if the Secretary of State has granted P permission for the purposes of this case to occupy a dwelling-house which is for the time being let on a protected tenancy or subject to a statutory tenancy. In this case “relevant national” means— (a)a British citizen, (b)a national of an EEA State other than the United Kingdom, or (c)a national of Switzerland.” (7)The amendments made by this section apply in relation to a tenancy entered into before or after the coming into force of this section.

(2)In Part 1 of Schedule 2 (assured tenancies: grounds on which court must order possession) after Ground 7A insert— Both of the following conditions are met in relation to a dwelling-house in England. Condition 1 is that the Secretary of State has given a notice in writing to the landlord or, in the case of joint landlords, one or more of them which identifies— (a)the tenant or, in the case of joint tenants, one or more of them, or (b)one or more other persons aged 18 or over who are occupying the dwelling-house, as a person or persons disqualified as a result of their immigration status from occupying the dwelling-house under the tenancy. Condition 2 is that the person or persons named in the notice— (a)fall within paragraph (a) or (b) of condition 1, and (b)are disqualified as a result of their immigration status from occupying the dwelling-house under the tenancy. For the purposes of this ground a person (“P”) is disqualified as a result of their immigration status from occupying the dwelling-house under the tenancy if— (a)P is not a relevant national, and (b)P does not have a right to rent in relation to the dwelling-house. P does not have a right to rent in relation to the dwelling-house if— (a)P requires leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom but does not have it, or (b)P's leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom is subject to a condition preventing P from occupying the dwelling-house. But P is to be treated as having a right to rent in relation to a dwelling-house if the Secretary of State has granted P permission for the purposes of this ground to occupy a dwelling-house under an assured tenancy.

(4)The effect of an order under this section is that, from the time the order takes effect, the qualifying tenant or tenants— (a)are entitled to performance of the landlord's covenants under the tenancy, and (b)are liable to perform the tenant's covenants under the tenancy. (5)The effect of an order under this section is that, from the time it takes effect, any other person who was a tenant under the tenancy before the order took effect— (a)ceases to be entitled to performance of the landlord's covenants under the tenancy, or (b)ceases to be liable to perform the tenant's covenants under the tenancy. (6)Subsection (5) does not remove any right or liability of the person which accrued before the order took effect. (7)An order under this section does not operate to create a new tenancy as between the landlord and the qualifying tenant or tenants. (8)In particular, if the tenancy is a fixed term tenancy, the term comes to an end at the same time as if the order had not been made.” (6)In Part 1 of Schedule 15 to the Rent Act 1977 (grounds for possession of dwelling-houses let on or subject to protected or statutory tenancies) after Case 10 insert— Both of the following conditions are met in relation to a dwelling-house in England. Condition 1 is that the Secretary of State has given a notice in writing to the landlord or, in the case of joint landlords, one or more of them which identifies— (a)the tenant or, in the case of joint tenants, one or more of them, or (b)one or more other persons aged 18 or over who are occupying the dwelling-house, as a person or persons disqualified as a result of their immigration status from occupying the dwelling-house under the tenancy. Condition 2 is that the person or persons named in the notice— (a)fall within paragraph (a) or (b) of condition 1, and (b)are disqualified as a result of their immigration status from occupying the dwelling-house under the tenancy. For the purposes of this case a person (“P”) is disqualified as a result of their immigration status from occupying the dwelling-house under the tenancy if— (a)P is not a relevant national, and (b)P does not have a right to rent in relation to the dwelling-house. P does not have a right to rent in relation to the dwelling-house if— (a)P requires leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom but does not have it, or (b)P's leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom is subject to a condition preventing P from occupying the dwelling-house.

(2)Sub-paragraph (3) applies if an appropriate judicial officer is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that a person liable to be arrested under this paragraph is to be found on any premises. (3)The appropriate judicial officer may issue a warrant authorising any immigration officer or constable to enter, by reasonable force if necessary, the premises named in the warrant for the purposes of searching for and arresting that person. (4)Sections 28J and 28K of the Immigration Act 1971 (warrants: application and execution) apply, with any necessary modifications, to warrants under sub-paragraph (3). (5)Sub-paragraph (6) applies where— (a)a warrant under this paragraph is issued for the purposes of the arrest of a person under this paragraph, and (b)an immigration officer or a constable enters premises in reliance on the warrant and detains a person on the premises. (6)A detainee custody officer may enter the premises, if need be by reasonable force, for the purpose of carrying out a search. (7)In sub-paragraph (6)— “detainee custody officer” means a person in respect of whom a certificate of authorisation is in force under section 154 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (detained persons: escort and custody), and “search” means a search under paragraph 2(1)(a) of Schedule 13 to that Act (escort arrangements: power to search detained person). (8)Paragraphs 25A to 25C of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 (entry and search of persons and premises) apply in relation to a person arrested under this paragraph as they apply in relation to a person arrested under that Schedule. (9)A person arrested under this paragraph— (a)must, as soon as is practicable after the person's arrest, be brought before the relevant authority, and (b)may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of State in the meantime. (10)The relevant authority is— (a)the Secretary of State, if the Secretary of State granted immigration bail to the arrested person or the First-tier Tribunal has directed that the power in paragraph 6(1) is exercisable by the Secretary of State in relation to that person, or (b)otherwise, the First-tier Tribunal. (11)Where an arrested person is brought before the relevant authority, the relevant authority must decide whether the arrested person has broken or is likely to break any of the bail conditions. (12)If the relevant authority decides the arrested person has broken or is likely to break any of the bail conditions, the relevant authority must— (a)direct that the person is to be detained under the provision mentioned in paragraph 1(1) under which the person is liable to be detained, or (b)grant the person bail subject to the same or different conditions, subject to sub-paragraph (14). (13)If the relevant authority decides the person has not broken and is not likely to break any of the bail conditions, the relevant authority must grant the person bail subject to the same conditions (but this is subject to sub-paragraph (14), and does not prevent the subsequent exercise of the powers in paragraph 6). (14)The power in sub-paragraph (12) to grant bail subject to the same conditions and the duty in sub-paragraph (13) to do so do not affect the requirement for the grant of bail to comply with paragraph 2. (15)In this paragraph— “appropriate judicial officer” means— in relation to England and Wales, a justice of the peace; in relation to Scotland, the sheriff or a justice of the peace; in relation to Northern Ireland, a lay magistrate; “premises”— in relation to England and Wales, has the same meaning as in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984; in relation to Scotland, has the same meaning as in section 412 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002; in relation to Northern Ireland, has the same meaning as in the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (SI 1989/1341 (NI 12)).

(as amended byS.I. 2018/31, reg. 2) 10(1)An immigration officer or a constable may arrest without warrant a person on immigration bail if the immigration officer or constable—U.K. (a)has reasonable grounds for believing that the person is likely to fail to comply with a bail condition, or (b)has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person is failing, or has failed, to comply with a bail condition. (2)Sub-paragraph (3) applies if an appropriate judicial officer is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that a person liable to be arrested under this paragraph is to be found on any premises. (3)The appropriate judicial officer may issue a warrant authorising any immigration officer or constable to enter, by reasonable force if necessary, the premises named in the warrant for the purposes of searching for and arresting that person. (4)Sections 28J and 28K of the Immigration Act 1971 (warrants: application and execution) apply, with any necessary modifications, to warrants under sub-paragraph (3). (5)Sub-paragraph (6) applies where— (a)a warrant under this paragraph is issued for the purposes of the arrest of a person under this paragraph, and (b)an immigration officer or a constable enters premises in reliance on the warrant and detains a person on the premises. (6)A detainee custody officer may enter the premises, if need be by reasonable force, for the purpose of carrying out a search. (7)In sub-paragraph (6)— “detainee custody officer” means a person in respect of whom a certificate of authorisation is in force under section 154 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (detained persons: escort and custody), and “search” means a search under paragraph 2(1)(a) of Schedule 13 to that Act (escort arrangements: power to search detained person). (8)Paragraphs 25A to 25C of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 (entry and search of persons and premises) apply in relation to a person arrested under this paragraph as they apply in relation to a person arrested under that Schedule. (9)A person arrested under this paragraph— (a)must, as soon as is practicable after the person's arrest, be brought before the relevant authority, and (b)may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of State in the meantime. (10)The relevant authority is— (a)the Secretary of State, if the Secretary of State granted immigration bail to the arrested person or the First-tier Tribunal has directed that the power in paragraph 6(1) is exercisable by the Secretary of State in relation to that person, or (b)otherwise, the First-tier Tribunal. (11)Where an arrested person is brought before the relevant authority, the relevant authority must decide whether the arrested person has broken or is likely to break any of the bail conditions. (12)If the relevant authority decides the arrested person has broken or is likely to break any of the bail conditions, the relevant authority must— (a)direct that the person is to be detained under the provision mentioned in paragraph 1(1) under which the person is liable to be detained, or (b)grant the person bail subject to the same or different conditions, subject to sub-paragraph (14). (13)If the relevant authority decides the person has not broken and is not likely to break any of the bail conditions, the relevant authority must grant the person bail subject to the same conditions (but this is subject to sub-paragraph (14), and does not prevent the subsequent exercise of the powers in paragraph 6). (14)The power in sub-paragraph (12) to grant bail subject to the same conditions and the duty in sub-paragraph (13) to do so do not affect the requirement for the grant of bail to comply with paragraph 2. (15)In this paragraph— “appropriate judicial officer” means— in relation to England and Wales, a justice of the peace; in relation to Scotland, the sheriff or a justice of the peace; in relation to Northern Ireland, a lay magistrate; “premises”— in relation to England and Wales, has the same meaning as in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984; in relation to Scotland, has the same meaning as in section 412 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002; in relation to Northern Ireland, has the same meaning as in the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (SI 1989/1341 (NI 12)).

schedule 10 paragraph 10,"10(1)An immigration officer or a constable may arrest without warrant a person on immigration bail if the immigration officer or constable—U.K. (a)has reasonable grounds for believing that the person is likely to fail to comply with a bail condition, or (b)has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person is failing, or has failed, to comply with a bail condition. (2)Sub-paragraph (3) applies if an appropriate judicial officer is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that a person liable to be arrested under this paragraph is to be found on any premises. (3)The appropriate judicial officer may issue a warrant authorising any immigration officer or constable to enter, by reasonable force if necessary, the premises named in the warrant for the purposes of searching for and arresting that person. (4)Sections 28J and 28K of the Immigration Act 1971 (warrants: application and execution) apply, with any necessary modifications, to warrants under sub-paragraph (3). (5)Sub-paragraph (6) applies where— (a)a warrant under this paragraph is issued for the purposes of the arrest of a person under this paragraph, and (b)an immigration officer or a constable enters premises in reliance on the warrant and detains a person on the premises. (6)A detainee custody officer may enter the premises, if need be by reasonable force, for the purpose of carrying out a search. (7)In sub-paragraph (6)— “detainee custody officer” means a person in respect of whom a certificate of authorisation is in force under section 154 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (detained persons: escort and custody), and “search” means a search under paragraph 2(1)(a) of Schedule 13 to that Act (escort arrangements: power to search detained person). (8)Paragraphs 25A to 25C of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 (entry and search of persons and premises) apply in relation to a person arrested under this paragraph as they apply in relation to a person arrested under that Schedule. (9)A person arrested under this paragraph— (a)must, as soon as is practicable after the person's arrest, be brought before the relevant authority, and (b)may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of State in the meantime. (10)The relevant authority is— (a)the Secretary of State, if the Secretary of State granted immigration bail to the arrested person or the First-tier Tribunal has directed that the power in paragraph 6(1) is exercisable by the Secretary of State in relation to that person, or (b)otherwise, the First-tier Tribunal. (11)Where an arrested person is brought before the relevant authority, the relevant authority must decide whether the arrested person has broken or is likely to break any of the bail conditions. (12)If the relevant authority decides the arrested person has broken or is likely to break any of the bail conditions, the relevant authority must— (a)direct that the person is to be detained under the provision mentioned in paragraph 1(1) under which the person is liable to be detained, or (b)grant the person bail subject to the same or different conditions, subject to sub-paragraph (14).

(2)For the purposes of this section carrying out an “immigration check” in relation to a current account means checking whether, according to information supplied by the Secretary of State to a specified anti-fraud organisation or a specified data-matching authority, the account is operated by or for a disqualified person. (3)A “disqualified person” is a person— (a)who is in the United Kingdom, (b)who requires leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom but does not have it, and (c)for whom the Secretary of State considers that a current account should not be provided by a bank or building society. (4)A current account is an excluded account for the purposes of subsection (1) if the account is operated by or for a person or body of a description specified in regulations made by the Treasury. (5)An account is operated by or for a person or body if the person or body is an account holder or a signatory or identified as a beneficiary in relation to the account. (6)A bank or building society must— (a)make arrangements with a specified anti-fraud organisation or a specified data-matching authority for the purpose of enabling the bank or building society to carry out immigration checks in relation to current accounts, and (b)pay any reasonable fee required to be paid under those arrangements.

(1)Where the Secretary of State receives a notification from a bank or building society under section 40B(2) in relation to a person, the Secretary of State must check whether the person is a disqualified person. (2)If the Secretary of State determines that the person is a disqualified person, the Secretary of State may apply under section 40D for a freezing order in respect of one or more of the accounts held with the bank or building society that are operated by or for the disqualified person. (3)If the Secretary of State decides not to apply for a freezing order under subsection (2), or decides to apply for a freezing order in respect of one or more but not all of the accounts held with the bank or building society that are operated by or for the disqualified person, the Secretary of State must notify the bank or building society that it is subject to the duty in section 40G(2) in relation to the disqualified person.

(2)A freezing order in respect of an account is an order that prohibits each person and body by or for whom the account is operated from making withdrawals or payments from the account. (3)A freezing order may be made subject to exceptions. (4)An exception may (in particular)— (a)make provision for the disqualified person to meet his or her reasonable living expenses and reasonable legal expenses; (b)allow another person or body by or for whom the account is operated to make withdrawals or payments from the account. (5)An application for a freezing order may be made without notice. (6)The court may vary or discharge a freezing order made in respect of an account (whether made under this section or on an appeal under section 40E) on an application made by— (a)the Secretary of State, or (b)a person or body by or for whom the account is operated.

(8)A notification made under subsection (7) must contain the information and be in the form and manner prescribed in regulations made under subsection (4) of section 40C for the purposes of subsection (3) of that section. (9)In this section— “the court” means— in England and Wales, a magistrates' court; in Scotland, the sheriff; in Northern Ireland, a court of summary jurisdiction; “the disqualified person” means the person who, following a check under section 40C(1), was determined to be a disqualified person, resulting in the application for the freezing order.

(2)The Secretary of State must from time to time review the code and may revise and re-issue it following a review. (3)The code (or revised code)— (a)may not be issued unless a draft has been laid before Parliament, and (b)comes into force in accordance with provision contained in regulations made by the Secretary of State. (1)This section applies where— (a)a bank or building society makes a notification under section 40B(2) in relation to a person, (b)the person is determined by the Secretary of State (following a check under section 40C(1)) to be a disqualified person, and (c)the bank or building society receives a notification under section 40C(3) or 40D(7) in relation to the disqualified person. (2)Where this section applies the bank or building society must as soon as reasonably practicable close each account held with it that— (a)in the case of a notification under section 40C(3), is operated by or for the disqualified person and is not the subject of an application for a freezing order; (b)in the case of a notification under section 40D(7), is operated by or for the disqualified person and in respect of which a freezing order is not in force.

(2)For the purposes of this section carrying out an “immigration check” in relation to a current account means checking whether, according to information supplied by the Secretary of State to a specified anti-fraud organisation or a specified data-matching authority, the account is operated by or for a disqualified person. (3)A “disqualified person” is a person— (a)who is in the United Kingdom, (b)who requires leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom but does not have it, and (c)for whom the Secretary of State considers that a current account should not be provided by a bank or building society.

(5)An account is operated by or for a person or body if the person or body is an account holder or a signatory or identified as a beneficiary in relation to the account. (6)A bank or building society must— (a)make arrangements with a specified anti-fraud organisation or a specified data-matching authority for the purpose of enabling the bank or building society to carry out immigration checks in relation to current accounts, and (b)pay any reasonable fee required to be paid under those arrangements.

(2)The Secretary of State must from time to time review the code and may revise and re-issue it following a review. (3)The code (or revised code)— (a)may not be issued unless a draft has been laid before Parliament, and (b)comes into force in accordance with provision contained in regulations made by the Secretary of State. (1)This section applies where— (a)a bank or building society makes a notification under section 40B(2) in relation to a person, (b)the person is determined by the Secretary of State (following a check under section 40C(1)) to be a disqualified person, and (c)the bank or building society receives a notification under section 40C(3) or 40D(7) in relation to the disqualified person. (2)Where this section applies the bank or building society must as soon as reasonably practicable close each account held with it that— (a)in the case of a notification under section 40C(3), is operated by or for the disqualified person and is not the subject of an application for a freezing order; (b)in the case of a notification under section 40D(7), is operated by or for the disqualified person and in respect of which a freezing order is not in force. (3)The bank or building society may delay closing an account which it would otherwise be required to close under subsection (2) if at the time at which it would otherwise be required to close it— (a)the account is overdrawn, or (b)where the account is operated by or for the disqualified person and one or more bodies or other persons, the bank or building society considers that closing the account would significantly adversely affect the interests of any of those other bodies or persons. (4)Where subsection (3) applies, closure of the account may be delayed for such period as is reasonable (but not indefinitely). (5)If an account falling within subsection (2) is operated by or for the disqualified person and one or more bodies or other persons, the bank or building society is to be treated as having complied with that subsection in relation to that account if, as soon as reasonably practicable, it takes all such steps as are necessary to prevent the account from being operated by or for the disqualified person (instead of closing the account). (6)Where the bank or building society closes an account in compliance with this section, it must tell each person or body by or for whom the account is operated, if it may lawfully do so, why it has closed the account. (7)Where the bank or building society prevents an account from being operated by or for the disqualified person by virtue of subsection (5), it must tell each person or body by or for whom the account is operated, if it may lawfully do so, why it has prevented the account from being operated by or for the disqualified person. (8)The bank or building society must provide the Secretary of State with information about the steps that it has taken to comply with this section.

(4)Where subsection (3) applies, closure of the account may be delayed for such period as is reasonable (but not indefinitely). (5)If an account falling within subsection (2) is operated by or for the disqualified person and one or more bodies or other persons, the bank or building society is to be treated as having complied with that subsection in relation to that account if, as soon as reasonably practicable, it takes all such steps as are necessary to prevent the account from being operated by or for the disqualified person (instead of closing the account). (6)Where the bank or building society closes an account in compliance with this section, it must tell each person or body by or for whom the account is operated, if it may lawfully do so, why it has closed the account.

(as amended byS.I. 2018/31, reg. 2) 10(1)An immigration officer or a constable may arrest without warrant a person on immigration bail if the immigration officer or constable—U.K. (a)has reasonable grounds for believing that the person is likely to fail to comply with a bail condition, or (b)has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person is failing, or has failed, to comply with a bail condition. (2)Sub-paragraph (3) applies if an appropriate judicial officer is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that a person liable to be arrested under this paragraph is to be found on any premises. (3)The appropriate judicial officer may issue a warrant authorising any immigration officer or constable to enter, by reasonable force if necessary, the premises named in the warrant for the purposes of searching for and arresting that person. (4)Sections 28J and 28K of the Immigration Act 1971 (warrants: application and execution) apply, with any necessary modifications, to warrants under sub-paragraph (3). (5)Sub-paragraph (6) applies where— (a)a warrant under this paragraph is issued for the purposes of the arrest of a person under this paragraph, and (b)an immigration officer or a constable enters premises in reliance on the warrant and detains a person on the premises. (6)A detainee custody officer may enter the premises, if need be by reasonable force, for the purpose of carrying out a search. (7)In sub-paragraph (6)— “detainee custody officer” means a person in respect of whom a certificate of authorisation is in force under section 154 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (detained persons: escort and custody), and “search” means a search under paragraph 2(1)(a) of Schedule 13 to that Act (escort arrangements: power to search detained person). (8)Paragraphs 25A to 25C of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 (entry and search of persons and premises) apply in relation to a person arrested under this paragraph as they apply in relation to a person arrested under that Schedule. (9)A person arrested under this paragraph— (a)must, as soon as is practicable after the person's arrest, be brought before the relevant authority, and (b)may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of State in the meantime. (10)The relevant authority is— (a)the Secretary of State, if the Secretary of State granted immigration bail to the arrested person or the First-tier Tribunal has directed that the power in paragraph 6(1) is exercisable by the Secretary of State in relation to that person, or (b)otherwise, the First-tier Tribunal. (11)Where an arrested person is brought before the relevant authority, the relevant authority must decide whether the arrested person has broken or is likely to break any of the bail conditions. (12)If the relevant authority decides the arrested person has broken or is likely to break any of the bail conditions, the relevant authority must— (a)direct that the person is to be detained under the provision mentioned in paragraph 1(1) under which the person is liable to be detained, or (b)grant the person bail subject to the same or different conditions, subject to sub-paragraph (14). (13)If the relevant authority decides the person has not broken and is not likely to break any of the bail conditions, the relevant authority must grant the person bail subject to the same conditions (but this is subject to sub-paragraph (14), and does not prevent the subsequent exercise of the powers in paragraph 6). (14)The power in sub-paragraph (12) to grant bail subject to the same conditions and the duty in sub-paragraph (13) to do so do not affect the requirement for the grant of bail to comply with paragraph 2. (15)In this paragraph— “appropriate judicial officer” means— in relation to England and Wales, a justice of the peace; in relation to Scotland, the sheriff or a justice of the peace; in relation to Northern Ireland, a lay magistrate; “premises”— in relation to England and Wales, has the same meaning as in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984; in relation to Scotland, has the same meaning as in section 412 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002; in relation to Northern Ireland, has the same meaning as in the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (SI 1989/1341 (NI 12)).
